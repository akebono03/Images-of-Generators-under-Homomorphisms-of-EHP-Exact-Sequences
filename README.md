Calculation of homotopy groups of spheres is a fundamental problem in algebraic topology.  
One of the basic tool is the EHP-sequence.  
E is the suspension homomorphism.  
H is the generalized Hopf invariant.  
P is essentially the Whitehead product.  
This application gives images of their homomorphisms.
